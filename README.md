# Green-Signal-Optimisation
INTRODUCTION :
-----------------------
The highest fuel consumption on urban arterials is associated with driving in congested traffic,  characterized by higher speed fluctuations and frequent stops at intersections. The best flow of  traffic on arterial streets, in terms of fuel consumption and emissions, is the one with fewest  stops, shortest delays, and moderate speeds maintained throughout a commute .

One of the ways to reduce excessive stop-and-go driving on urban streets is to optimize  signal timings. Historically, signal timing optimization tools were developed to reduce delays  and stops experienced by urban drivers. More recently new methods in traffic signal optimization  have incorporated changes in driversâ€™ behavior to achieve optimum performance at signalized intersections. 

METHODOLOGY :
---------------------------
Methodologically, this paper presents a novel and simplistic method to derive vehicle position  and order in the vehicular queue based on basic kinematic formulas for speed and discharge  headways/saturation flow rates. Another significant contribution is the integration of the grey wolf and bat algorithm .The tests are  performed on a two-intersection traffic network whose simulation performance metrics are  calibrated and validated to resemble those observed in the field.
