# Green-Signal-Optimisation
INTRODUCTION :
-----------------------
The highest fuel consumption on urban arterials is associated with driving in congested traffic,  characterized by higher speed fluctuations and frequent stops at intersections. The best flow of  traffic on arterial streets, in terms of fuel consumption and emissions, is the one with fewest  stops, shortest delays, and moderate speeds maintained throughout a commute .

One of the ways to reduce excessive stop-and-go driving on urban streets is to optimize  signal timings. Historically, signal timing optimization tools were developed to reduce delays  and stops experienced by urban drivers. More recently new methods in traffic signal optimization  have incorporated changes in drivers’ behavior to achieve optimum performance at signalized intersections. 

METHODOLOGY :
---------------------------
Methodologically, this paper presents a novel and simplistic method to derive vehicle position  and order in the vehicular queue based on basic kinematic formulas for speed and discharge  headways/saturation flow rates. Another significant contribution is the integration of the grey wolf and bat algorithm .The tests are  performed on a two-intersection traffic network whose simulation performance metrics are  calibrated and validated to resemble those observed in the field.

ABOUT ALGORITHM:
--------------------------------
Bio-inspired algorithms are now becoming powerful methods for solving many real-world optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach involving Grey Wolf optimizer (GWO) and Bat swarm optimizer (BA) for global function optimization problems. GWO is well known for its balanced exploration/exploitation behavior, while BA is known to be more exploitative due to its low exploration ability in some conditions. We use GWO exploration skills to explore the search space effectively and BA local search capabilities to refine the solution. In our hybrid algorithm, namely (GWOBA), GWO is used to explore the problem space alone and pass the best two solutions to BA to guide its local search, then BA digs deeper and finds the best solution.
